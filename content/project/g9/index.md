- First long term project for Front-End

- Basically follows a MVC structure; to be precise, builds upon early Flux structure by using a React-Redux basic framework combination

- Run in tandem with an Express.js based Node.js runtime server; all meaningful data is initially stored in the server, while the SPA client portion tries to run as a strict View with as less extra logic as possible

- Helpful during inception as it taught me other important Front-End skills other than JS, especially modern CSS core concepts such as Media Query, variable naming, Grid layout and more

- After the initial project was done in ES6 JavaScript, it was manually ported to TypeScript then bundled with Webpack
